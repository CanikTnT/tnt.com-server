Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.
 
   What motivates Ruleset additions
      
Focus goals for MP2-Dragoon

============================= CHANGES ======================
1. Granary Size, Population Changes:
       S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  S10
MP2C:  20  30  40  50  60  70  70  70  70...
MP2D:  16  23  31  40  50  60  70  71  72...
This speeds the early game with a tightly controlled 
mathematical solution: a sweet spot to accelerate the foodbox
without bad side effects on the proportional balance of other
game elements. Speeding up the foodbox has been tried by
others for a long time, but with "mathematically diseased side
effects". This simple solution is a magic formula for 
preserving the magic of the original classical balance. 
This change does more than just that. It simultaneously
improves 2 flaws in the Discrete Mathematics of the system.
Those flaws heavily discouraged size 3 cities under Despotism,
and discouraged making new cities for the last 40%
of the game. Those phenomena are now softened.
============================================================
2. Mountain Goats (3 1 0) & Hippopotami (3 1 0)
============================================================
3. Goods are now available with Pottery and cost 20. Can now
help build wonders. Recycle penalty reduced to 3 shields. 
The tech, cost, wonder, and recycle changes allow Goods to
to fulfill their purpose of enhancing early game depth and
richness.
============================================================
4. "Advisor" for buildings suggests an order similar to 
   an experienced player, instead of alphabetic.
============================================================
5. Fix, Transport inaccurately documented as causing
   unhappiness. (Units with 0 Attack do not cause unhappy)
============================================================
6. Under Despotism, All new cities get +2 food when
   founded (+4 for capital).
   ...
   Scarcity and hard survivalism both under despotism and 
   resourcefulness of nomadic ways, resulted in people
   hoarding preserved food sources.
   1. This reduces the early game "slow period" by about 1 turn.
   2. It furthers the project of quantitative easing against the
   forcing-effect of "leave Despotism for Monarchy ASAP".
   Gradually people will wake up into realising a multiplicity
   of Bronze Age diversity exists. 
============================================================
7. With Pyramids, cities start with +6 food. (Was 5 in MP2C).
   6/16 rather than 5/20 compensates the increase in cost and
   science requirements. Pyramid strategies will be more
   non-conformist, rare, and more of a commitment, but also
   more interesting. Pyramids must be built before 
   discovering Democracy.
============================================================
8. Partisans can investigate conquered cities not owned 
   by the original owner.
============================================================
9. Ziggurat 
   was least popular Tribe Wonder:
      no economic bonus except from relocating capital;
   NOW:
      * shield output has no tile penalties
      * +1 food on city centre, Settlers have no food upkeep
      * no longer requires river
=============================================================
10. Riflemen and Alpines upgrade to Ground Troops
      * cost is only 4 gold.
=============================================================
11. Mausoleum
   Effectively, upkeep on Courthouses is free.
   Courthouses cost 5 less; during Despotism, they cost the
     same as a temple.
=============================================================
12. Hills Vision
   hills give half the vision bonus of mountains;
   (sees 4 more tiles instead of 8 [corner tiles]
=============================================================
13. Agoge reduces Phalanx price 3 shields.
   Counts as a Barracks in its home city. 
   increases chance of veteran promotion 50% for phalanxes
   (this is not +50% odds, it's +50% frequency)
=============================================================
14. New cities get a +2 nomad food bonus in Despotism. Stacks
    with Pyramids. Capital city gets 2x nomad food bonus on
    founding. (+4)
=============================================================
15. Explorer renamed to Scout. Available with Horseback Riding,
   moves 4 tiles (6 with Map Making, which then makes it identical
   to previous Explorer. Cost reduced 2 shields, same as 
   Horsemen.)
=============================================================
16. QUAY upgrades
   a. Quay-to-Road and Road-to-Quay uses 2/3 move point. (was 1/3, 3/3)
   b. Exiting a city with a quay remains 1/3 move point  (was 1/3)
   c. Time to build Quay is now 1 worker-turn: encourage ancient river importance.
   d. Exiting quay now being 2/3 instead of 1/3 or 1/9 (rail), reduces territorial 
      risk of making quays, somewhat.
   A new server feature simplifies this. <ADD TO: SIMPLIFIERS>
=============================================================
17. Ecclesiastical Palace, cost:70 (was 90). (same as Palace)
=============================================================
18. Zeus promotion bonus simplified: instead of The Republic
   tech turning it off, it's having Republic government 
   (or any later government) that turns off the bonus.
   This would allows monarchies and despotism to pursue 
   Banking without the Statue losing its "pre-Republic bonus
   effect."
=============================================================
19. Adam Smith wonder adjusted back to 300 gold; the former 
   cost increase had been implemented before the WYSIWYG 
   upgrade, which now makes this wonder less OP and no
   longer justifying the cost increase.
=============================================================
20. Legion price adjust 31 (was 32) - got 10% discount like 
   all other units, off classic price, but was overpriced in 
   classic. should be 36 or 37 with 20% reduction giving 29-30
   in cost. Legion's extra abilities worth +1 shield from
   that. also, Ironworking 70 (was 80).
=============================================================
21. Hideouts  
   temporary patch requirement for unit to be alone
   was fixed after a bug fig no longer requires this.
=============================================================
22. Tile Claims 
   Fixed a bug where tile claims were only cardinally adjacent
   Requirement for diplomat to be accompanied is only if not 
      in domestic territory.
   Can be now be made on any tile adjacent to existing claim.
   Conflict where Tile Claim can't be made in a base, was 
      fixed.
=============================================================
23. New tech tiers allow making Magnetism a pre-req for 
   Steam Engine ..... FINALLY !!!!
=============================================================
24. No sea commerce units cause unhappiness, for consistency
   and simplification.
=============================================================
25. Cathedral costs 70 (was 75)
=============================================================
26. Nationalism is +20% sci in original cities
    balances that -15% is global for lux 
=============================================================
27. Clarification: AAA are considered as part of 
   Marine corps land/air/sea. Thus, have gold upkeep not 
   shield upkeep.
=============================================================
28. Zeppelin 5 turns of fuel: more realistic and provides 
   more possible use for this special unit.
=============================================================
29. Fixed bug (also mp2c) where Airplane was not counted 
   as non-military and couldn't do diplomatic missions 
   to nations with whom you're at peace.
=============================================================
30. Jet aircraft upgrades
Were underpowered relative to other units.

A/D jets/mech inf is now only slightly less than
A/D fighters/alpines (was substantially less, at a time when
    SAM Battery becomes available to make it even worse.)

Stealth Fighter
   A9 D6 Cost:85 was A8 D4.
Jet Fighter
   A7 D6, was A6 D5. (better defender than escort fighter)
Ground Strike Fighter
   A8 D5, was A7 D4

Multirole Fighter, upgrades Escort Fighter
   A6 D7 two turns fuel. Cost: 90
   Range fighter
=============================================================
31. Rapture Rate is here. Allows govs to participate in
   it at different rates; which allows finer balancing of 
   the govs to make them more usable and interesting.

Cons.Monarchy - Raptures cities not founded by you 
   1 out of 4 turns until they have no foreigners, 
   at which point it becomes 3 out of 5 turns.

Democracy - Cities with 10%+ foreigners rapture at 50%

Communism - Cities rapture 2 out of 5 turns

Theocracy - Raptures 2 out of 5 turns;
  building a Cathedral changes rate to 1 out of 2 turns.

Nationalism - Foreign cities rapture 1 out of 3 turns
   until no longer foreign, then at 2 out of 3 turns.
=============================================================
32. Terrain Walls
=============================================================
33. SentryAlways 
		scout, balloon, zeppelin, e.fighter, m.fighter, 
      partisan, awacs, spy plane, satellite
=============================================================
34. Destroy City - Massacre a city (gives global casus belli)
Requires 2 units on til, actor must be capturer-type.
Foreign city: Foreign: mustn't be Demo, Theo; city
size 2-8; 
Domestic city: only avail to Despo, Commie;
15% foreign, must use (D)o command. size 1-8;
==============================================================

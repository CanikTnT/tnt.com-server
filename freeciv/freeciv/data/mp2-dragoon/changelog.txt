Focus goals for MP2-Dragoon

============================= CHANGES ======================
1. Granary Size, Population Changes:
            S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  S10
MP2C:       20  30  40  50  60  70  70  70  70...

MP2D X2:    15  20  25  31  37  45  53  60  60...
ttg @+2      8  10  13  16  19  22  27  30  30
pyramid      8  12  15  19  ...

pyr+gran.   --   5   5   7

This speeds the early game with a tightly controlled 
mathematical solution: a sweet spot to accelerate the foodbox
without bad side effects on the proportional balance of other
game elements. Speeding up the foodbox has been tried by
others for a long time, but with "mathematically diseased side
effects". This simple solution is a magic formula for 
preserving the magic of the original classical balance. 
This change does more than just that. It simultaneously
improves 2 flaws in the Discrete Mathematics of the system.
Those flaws heavily discouraged size 3 cities under Despotism,
and discouraged making new cities for the last 40%
of the game. Those phenomena are now softened.
Mathematical processing of 3 other models from X1 to X4,
mildest to extreme, were also balanced. X2 as the middle
was chosen for main default mp2d rules.
============================================================
2. Mountain Goats (3 1 0) & Hippopotami (3 1 0)
============================================================
3. Goods are now available with Pottery and cost 20. Can now
help build wonders. Recycle penalty reduced to 3 shields. 
The tech, cost, wonder, and recycle changes allow Goods to
to fulfill their purpose of enhancing early game depth and
richness.
============================================================
4. "Advisor" for buildings suggests an order similar to 
   an experienced player, instead of alphabetic.
============================================================
5. Fix, Transport inaccurately documented as causing
   unhappiness. (Units with 0 Attack do not cause unhappy)
============================================================
6. Under Despotism, All new cities get +2 food when
   founded (+4 for capital). This stacks with Pyramids.
   ...
   Scarcity and hard survivalism both under despotism and 
   resourcefulness of nomadic ways, resulted in people
   hoarding preserved food sources.
   1. This reduces the early game "slow period" by about 1 turn.
   2. It furthers the project of quantitative easing against the
   forcing-effect of "leave Despotism for Monarchy ASAP".
   Gradually people will wake up into realising a multiplicity
   of Bronze Age diversity exists. 
============================================================
7. With Pyramids, cities start with 33% or +5 food for 5/15.
   (MP2C was: 25% or 5/20.).
   This compensates the increase in Pyramids cost and the
   higher science requirements. Pyramid strategies will be
   more interesting.
   Cost: 180 (was 200)
   Gives its city a rapture rate of 100% regardless of gov.
============================================================
8. Partisans can investigate conquered cities not owned 
   by the original owner. Partisans join the sentry always
   class of units. Partisans gain +2/9 moves per veteran
   level. Partisans also gain whatever vet level effects
   are operative from Barracks or wonders (all rulesets).
============================================================
9. Ziggurat 
   was least popular Tribe Wonder:
      no economic bonus except from relocating capital;
   NOW:
      * shield output has no tile penalties
      * +1 food on city centre, Settlers have no food upkeep
      * no longer requires river
=============================================================
10. Riflemen and Alpines upgrade to Ground Troops
      * cost is only 4 gold.
=============================================================
11. Mausoleum
   Effectively, upkeep on Courthouses is free.
   Courthouses cost 5 less; during Despotism, they cost the
     same as a temple.
=============================================================
12. Hills Vision
   hills give half the vision bonus of mountains;
   (sees 4 more tiles instead of 8 [corner tiles]
=============================================================
13. Agoge reduces Phalanx price 3 shields.
   Counts as a Barracks in its home city.
   +1 move bonus for starting turn in city now applies to
      all cities, not just Agoge city. 
   Increases chance of veteran promotion 50% for phalanxes
   (this is not +50% odds, it's +50% frequency), i.e:
   50 33 20 15 becomes 75 50 30 22
   Agoge + Barracks in a city allows making hardened Phalanxes
=============================================================
14. Techs and Costs:
   Monotheism 300 (384), Theology 400 (600), Theocracy 500 (725)
   Invention 490 (468), Democracy 950 (875), Banking 475 (364)
   Medicine 475 (468) Ironworking 65 (80). Philosophy 325 (276)
   Navigation 500 (485). University 450 (415). 
   Chemistry 900 (800)
   Astronomy, Feudalism, Trade, Republic 150 (145)

   Misc techs rounded to clean numbers. 
   Philosophy now gives a 70% blueprint instead of a full tech.
=============================================================
15. Explorer changed to Scout. Available with Horseback Riding,
   moves 4 tiles (6 with Map Making, which makes it identical
   to the Explorer.) Cost reduced 2 shields to be the same 
   as Horseme. Gains +2/9 move per veteran level.
=============================================================
16. QUAY upgrades
   a. Quay-to-Road and Road-to-Quay uses 2/3 move point. (was 1/3, 3/3)
   b. Exiting a city with a quay remains 1/3 move point  (was 1/3)
   c. Time to build Quay is now 1 worker-turn: encourage ancient river importance.
   d. Exiting quay now being 2/3 instead of 1/3 or 1/9 (rail), reduces territorial 
      risk of making quays, somewhat.
   A new server feature simplifies this. <ADD TO: SIMPLIFIERS>
=============================================================
17. Ecclesiastical Palace, cost:70 (was 90). (same as Palace)
=============================================================
18. Zeus promotion bonus changed: instead of The Republic
   tech turning it off, it's Monotheism or Communism that
   turns off the bonus. The two different "make content"
   bonuses were clarified.
=============================================================
19. Adam Smith wonder adjusted back to 300 cost; the former 
   cost increase had been implemented before the WYSIWYG 
   upgrade, which now makes this wonder less OP and no
   longer justifying the cost increase.
=============================================================
20. Legion price adjust 30 (was 32) - got 20% discount like 
   all other foot units, off the classic price, but it was
   overpriced in classic.
=============================================================
21. Hideouts  
   temporary patch requirement for unit to be alone
   was fixed after a bug fix no longer requires this.
=============================================================
22. Tile Claims 
   Fixed a bug where tile claims were only cardinally adjacent
   Requirement for diplomat to be accompanied is only if not 
      in domestic territory.
   Can be now be made on any tile adjacent to existing claim.
   Conflict where Tile Claim can't be made in a base, was 
      fixed.
=============================================================
23. University Pre-req for Steam Engine changed to
   Magnetism. In most cases this will mean Frigates now
   come two techs before Ironclads; rather than possibly
   after.
=============================================================
24. No sea commerce units cause unhappiness, for consistency
   and simplification.
=============================================================
25. Cathedral costs 70 (was 75)
=============================================================
26. Nationalism is +20% sci in original cities
    balances that -15% is global for lux 
=============================================================
27. Clarification: AAA are considered as part of 
   Marine corps land/air/sea. Thus, have gold upkeep not 
   shield upkeep; and get Infantry build slot bonus.
=============================================================
28. Zeppelin 5 turns of fuel: more realistic and provides 
   more possible use for this special unit.
=============================================================
29. Fixed bug (also mp2c) where Airplane was not counted 
   as non-military and couldn't do diplomatic missions 
   to nations with whom you're at peace.
=============================================================
30. Jet fighter types, upgrades
Were underpowered relative to other units.

A:D ratio of jets:mech.inf is now only slightly less than
A:D fighters:alpines (was substantially less, at a time when
    SAM Battery becomes available to make it even worse.)

Stealth Fighter
   A9 D6 Cost:85 was A8 D4.
Jet Fighter
   A7 D6, was A6 D5. (better defender than escort fighter)
Ground Strike Fighter
   A8 D5, was A7 D4

Multirole Fighter, upgrades Escort Fighter
   A6 D7 two turns fuel. Cost: 90
   Range fighter
=============================================================
31. Rapture Rate is here. Allows most govs to participate in
   it at different rates; which allows finer balancing of 
   the govs to make them more usable and interesting.

=============================================================
32. Terrain Walls - The Great Wall wonder allows 
one to build walls right on the map. The terrain properties
are:
1. Takes one turn to build.
2. Takes four turns to pillage.
3. Can't be built on a Base, River, or Canal
4. Non-allied units lose all move points moving onto a wall,
and lose all move points moving off of a wall
5. Enemy units who are on a non-allied wall tile and have 
no moves left, are considered as 'attempting to scale the
wall' and in a vulnerable state, and have a -50% defense 
while caught on the wall with no moves left.
6. Allied units on a wall are considered fortified for free,
even if not in a fortified state.
=============================================================
33. SentryAlways 
		scout, balloon, zeppelin, e.fighter, m.fighter, 
      partisan, awacs, spy plane, satellite
=============================================================
34. Destroy City - Massacre a city (gives global casus belli)
Requires 2 units on tile, actor must be capturer-type.
Foreign city: destroyer gov mustn't be Demo, Theo; 
city size 2-8; 
Domestic city: only avail to Despo, Commie;
15% foreign, must use (D)o command. size 1-8;
==============================================================
35. Huts can now also give:
  * Small bulb awards (1-5 bulbs).
  * a Boat (if on a river)
  * Goods (if discovered by a unit who can carry Goods)
  * A map of the surrounding area (14 tile diameter)
==============================================================
36. Nomadism / Early game balance bonuses 
During the first 5 turns, each Settler gets 1 bulb/turn; this
represents the fact that nomads can learn things too, and
causes less penalty for players in bad starting position 
who must migrate to decent starting position.
==============================================================
37. Boats 8hp - Triremes and Warriors can beat them; similar
   to what was done with Workers/Tribesmen.
==============================================================
38. DUPLICATE OF 32. Terrain Walls are available to be made for any nation 
 who owns The Great Wall. To build them you must select 
 Tile Target with the (D)o command. Features: non-allied 
 units lose all moves when entering or exiting a tile with
 walls. Domestic units get a free fortify bonus on walls,
 which stacks with real fortification. Foreign units who 
 are caught on walls with no move points left get a -50%
 defense penalty. Can't be built on Mountains, Rivers, Bases.
 Be careful, pillage time is 4 turns. 
==============================================================
39. Theocracy spawns Zealots instead of Partisans 
==============================================================
40. Wild Animal hunting now gives food (for edible types).
/set animals >0
==============================================================
41. Mobile SAM gets 2x defense against Missile units,
   and can now carry two missiles.
42. Armor II bonus vs. Missiles cut to 50% was (100% i.e. 2x)
this buffs the little used Mobile SAM to more usefulness in
tactical operations and nerfs the Armor II which was getting 
too much use as an anti-cruise missile defender unit instead 
of its intended purpose.
==============================================================
43. EFT_REHOME_PCT alters the likelihood of units disbanding
    from conquered/razed cities based on gov type.
    Despotism:15,Monarchy:30,CM/Comm:45,Repub/Natl:60,
    Demo:75,Theo:90
==============================================================
44. Angkor Wat reduces city celebration from 3 to 2.
    Angkor Wat now also works for Theocracy government.
==============================================================
45.Lighthouse never obsolete, but must be built before 
   Electricity. Movement bonus reduces to +1 when combined
   with Nuclear Power bonus. Magellan gives +1 move to 
   nations who don't have Lighthouse. 
==============================================================
46. Citadel of Aleppo - 3x defense impervious to ballistic
   units and siege ram. Allows each nation to make one 
   special fortress city with the same strength as old 
   city walls, to feel safe about it. Cost:120
==============================================================
47. Ballista unit - 
==============================================================
48. Chand Baori - cost 65 (was 80)
==============================================================
49. Diplomatic Units 
   Emissary - early diplomat, costs 24 (was 26), cannot sabotage cities, moves 3
   Diplomat - req:Economics, costs 30 (was 26), can establish embassy without spent
   Spy - can no longer establish embassy. Emissaries upgrade to Diplomats for free.

   Results:
   (1) Reduced cost with less speed and ability to sabotage,
       is more appreciated for early game use and balance.
   (2) Siege Ram needed for taking out city walls, makes the
       unit more purposeful.
   (3) Ability to establish multiple embassies for slightly
       higher cost, is more appreciated around the time the
       Diplomat now becomes availiable; improves globalness
       of the game.
   (4) Inability for Spy to make hostile embassy (especially
       having 6 moves), repurposes the unit better for
       espionage, decreases OPness, and increases game
       depth and intrigue in having multiple types of 
       diplomatic units.
==============================================================
50. Corruption reducing buildings and wonders will always be
guaranteed to reduce at least 1 corruption (if there is any).
This finally solves an age-old freeciv problem the came from
"double-truncation-rounding" error, which made corruption
reduction nearly worthless in small despotism cities
or medium monarchy cities; yet these are the exact contexts
when corruption loss as a percentage of GDP are at their 
worst and when the game can greatly benefit by an improvement
to help with corruption. 
Courthouse, Palace, Ecclesiastical Palace, Sphinx, Ziggurat,
Supreme Court, and Mausoleum of Mausolos will all reduce
a minimum of 1 corruption, if there is any corruption.
==============================================================
51. JTIDS cost 275 (was 230).
==============================================================
52. AAA need 9 turns of service + 3 turns to convert to M.Sam
    (was 10 + 4).
==============================================================
53. Small balance adjust to early starting techs, gives micro-
expansion of early bronze age strategic pathways, decreases
new-gov rush slightly. Most techs go to 22, masonry and
bronze working go to 20.
==============================================================
54. Theology gives blueprints for Theocracy.
==============================================================
55. Theocracies can make the Patriarch unique unit, which is a
diplomatic unit that bribes and incites at 1/3 the cost.
==============================================================
56. Zealots can change home city to a foreign ally who is 
 Theocratic. This allows more fluid strategies of bringing 
 all Zealots to fight together under the same command, and
 even for former Theocracies to re-home Zealots into allied
 Theocracies in order to avoid the double-unhappiness
 upkeep which Zealots suffer when not under Theocracy.
==============================================================
57. Theocracy can incite other cities at a 33% discount.
==============================================================
58. Crew Repair simplified: every type of ship gets 10% repair:
i.e., effectively +1 hp more than previously: providing a
slight buff to ship durability and usability, and bringing the
successfully tested crew repair to the ancient (wooden ships)
This combines with improved Lighthouse/Nuclear Power effects.
==============================================================
59. req #2 for Gunpowder changed from Iron Working to 
Feudalism (which needs Iron Working anyway)...fixes some
issues with tech tree flow.
==============================================================
60. Theocracy corruption changed from 2% + 2% per tile to 
 0% + 1% per tile.
==============================================================
61. Theocracy gets a free +1 happy per city.
==============================================================
62. Police Station does +2 forced content under authoritarian
    govs. No longer does +1 make_content_mil under nationalism
==============================================================
63. No stack death takes place on ruins. Undocumented effect 
 that hideouts don't disappear in ruins is now documented.
==============================================================
64. Homeland Security prevents Poison City from taking place.
==============================================================
65. Communism: celebrating cities with granaries get +1 food
to city tile.
==============================================================
66. City Walls are 2x defense like all other defense-types.
Fixes a confusion where 3x was wrongly attributed because it
was customary to consider City Walls as 3x because the free-
fortify bonus of 1.5x means the total bonus of defenders in
cities with walls was 3x. However, this resulted in the 
free-fortify bonus being multiplied twice for units in 
cities with walls, creating 4.5x. The result of this mistake
made some dramatic changes to gameplay:
-the ability to rapid-buy walls in an emergency for chokepoint
cities for 4.5x instead of 3x meant the game became skewed to
not needing to buy as many military units, and thus 
more heavily economic until post-gunpowder heavy 
weaponry was discovered.
-greatly force-multiplied the strategic dynamics of
"playing sim city while gunpowder rushing"
-took away from bronze age and iron age warfare
-made the game heavily "aerocentric" since SAM Batteries 
are only 2x defense (instead of 4.5x); this resulted in:
-"flight rushing" being force multiplied more than it should
-the "chess tactics" of ground warfare, zoc, positional
warfare, etc., being greatly reduced.
-land conquest and control of non-city terrestrial positions
and borders were greatly reduced and replaced with a game of
"city pounding"
-disrupted tactical integrity of the game.
==============================================================
67. City Fortifications cleaned and simplified.
Simply adds +0.33 to the terrain defense bonus 
(+0.50 for Flatland). Gets same +10 cost increase as 
City walls, after metallurgy. All other iffy conditionals 
cleaned out and removed. 
==============================================================
68. All Ballistic type units can now SUA iff they haven't 
moved; are also able to SUA against oceanic tiles (if not
trasported.) 
==============================================================
69. Most ships gain +1 move. Adjusts a discrepancy between
their speed and that of corresponding land units using roads.
Ships to not gain +1 = Trireme, Longboat, Ram Ship
Frigate gets +2 (had received a +1 adjustment prior to all
ships getting a general +1). This changes also lessens 
the "molasses effect" in island games, where all sea-based 
operations are excessively slower than land operations.
==============================================================
70. Shore attacks for modern ships changed:
  • Battle will last 20 combat rounds, which may or may not result
    in a victor.
  • Chance of attacker promotion is half frequency: 2 battles
    required for same chance of promotion as 1 sea battle. 
  • Firepower is reduced to 1. Attack strength is increased +33%
    * Overall effect is -33% reduction in attack strength, less
      chance of promotion, less chance of fatality for either
      combatant, but generally in spite of this, more effective
      and tactically usable with more frequency in more
      contextual situations.
==============================================================
71. Bunkers have 90% chance to resist nuclear detonation.
i.e., units inside won't die.
==============================================================
72. All ships gain +1 to their minimum speed when damaged:
Boat, Trireme, Riverships: 3 (was 2)
Submarines: 5 (was 4)
all other Sea Units: 4 (was 3)
==============================================================
73. If in a city and not qualified for any other healing 
effect, a minimum +1 hp healing takes place. (e.g., no 
healing from barracks, being fortified, +1/3hp for staying
on turn in city and not moving, or +10% for being on a tile
and not moving for a whole turn.)
==============================================================
74. Default blueprints is 65 (was 70)
    Default techleak is 50 (was 40)
Slight penalty for "technology gangs" and slightly more help
for those not in one. Note the slightly more bulbs needed 
at 65% blueprint is somewhat lessened by higher techleak.    
==============================================================
75. Latejoin gold is 14/turn instead of 13, as early game is
somewhat faster in mp2d
==============================================================
76. Capture and Expel both cost 2/3 move. (Was 1, 2/3)
==============================================================
77. Fishtraps become available with Refrigeration technology.
 A Fishtrap provides +2 food to its tile. Any Fish adjacent to
 the tile will be raised to +6 food output and gain +1 trade.
 Fishtraps must be made adjacent to Fish, but cannot be made
 cardinally adjacent to each other. Nor can they be built
 directly on a tile with Fish, Whales, or a Buoy.
==============================================================
78. Except for Aircraft, Missiles, and Marines, the move cost
to Deboard and Board is 1/3, likewise a Transport doing Load
or Unload causes 1/3 move cost to all the units which that 
command causes to Deboard or Board. This is a "balanced 
compromise" to (1) reducing "double move" phenomena using
mulitple load/unload on multiple transports, while (2) at same
time not excessively slowing the longturn pace and aggravating
the already cumbersome transport logistics.
==============================================================
79. Techleak, when tallying the total number of players vs.
the number of players having a tech: doesn't count dead
players, Barbarian players, NewAvailablePlayers, and players
who are idle 5 or more turns.
==============================================================
80. MagLevs can only be built wherever railroads may be built,
(i.e. Road and SeaBridge). A railroad is not required. They
can't be built on ocean (unless SeaBridge.)
==============================================================
82. Copernicus costs 90 (was 100).
==============================================================
83. Trawlers are work-boats that can do Fishtraps, Buoys,
 Roads, Quays, Canals, Sea Bridges, & clean pollution/fallout.
 Trawlers can carry one Land unit, usually Engineers or 
 Workers, to expedite their water work. Trawlers can tow ships 
 at a reduced rate of -3 move points. Towing gets damaged
 ships back to port for repair and helps crew repair rates 
 if the damaged is resting while towed. If a Trawler stops
 towing it recovers pro-rated move points.
==============================================================
84. New feature, cargo on some types of transports is openly
visible. Current test case are Wagons and Trawlers.

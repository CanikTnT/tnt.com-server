Brief Explanations of goals and challenges.
   Simplicity vs. Complexity.
 
   What motivates Ruleset additions
      
Focus goals for MP2-Dragoon

============================= CHANGES ======================
1. Granary Size, Population Changes:
       S2  S3  S4  S5  S6  S7  S8  S9  S10
MP2C:  20  30  40  50  60  70  70  70  70...
MP2D:  16  23  30  40  50  60  70  70  70...
This speeds the early game with a tightly controlled 
mathematical solution: a sweet spot to accelerate the foodbox
without bad side effects on the proportional balance of other
game elements. Speeding up the foodbox has been tried by
others for a long time, but with "mathematically diseased side
effects". This simple solution is a magic formula for 
preserving the magic of the original classical balance. 
This change does more than just that. It simultaneously
improves 2 flaws in the Discrete Mathematics of the system.
Those flaws heavily discouraged size 3 cities under Despotism,
and discouraged making new cities for the last 40%
of the game. Those phenomena are now softened.
============================================================
2. Mountain Goats (3 1 0) & Hippopotami (3 1 0)
============================================================
3. Goods are now available with Pottery and cost 20. Can now
help build wonders. Recycle penalty reduced to 3 shields. 
The tech, cost, wonder, and recycle changes allow Goods to
to fulfill their purpose of enhancing early game depth and
richness.
============================================================
4. "Advisor" for buildings suggests an order similar to 
   an experienced player, instead of alphabetic.
============================================================
5. Fix, Transport inaccurately documented as causing
   unhappiness. (Units with 0 Attack do not cause unhappy)
============================================================
6. Under Despotism, All new cities get +2 food when
   founded (+4 for capital). Stacks with Pyramids.
   ...
   Scarcity and hard survivalism both under despotism and 
   resourcefulness of nomadic ways, resulted in people
   hoarding preserved food sources.
   1. This reduces the early game "slow period" by about 1 turn.
   2. It furthers the project of quantitative easing against the
   forcing-effect of "leave Despotism for Monarchy ASAP".
   Gradually people will wake up into realising a multiplicity
   of Bronze Age diversity exists. 
============================================================
7. With Pyramids, cities start with +6 food. (Was 5 in MP2C).
   6/16 rather than 5/20 compensates the increase in cost and
   science requirements. Pyramid strategies will be more
   non-conformist, rare, and more of a commitment, but also
   more interesting. Pyramids must be built before 
   discovering Democracy.
   Cost: 180 (was 200)
   Gives its city a rapture rate of 100% regardless of gov.
============================================================
8. Partisans can investigate conquered cities not owned 
   by the original owner.
============================================================
9. Ziggurat 
   was least popular Tribe Wonder:
      no economic bonus except from relocating capital;
   NOW:
      * shield output has no tile penalties
      * +1 food on city centre, Settlers have no food upkeep
      * no longer requires river
=============================================================
10. Riflemen and Alpines upgrade to Ground Troops
      * cost is only 4 gold.
=============================================================
11. Mausoleum
   Effectively, upkeep on Courthouses is free.
   Courthouses cost 5 less; during Despotism, they cost the
     same as a temple.
=============================================================
12. Hills Vision
   hills give half the vision bonus of mountains;
   (sees 4 more tiles instead of 8 [corner tiles]
=============================================================
13. Agoge reduces Phalanx price 3 shields.
   Counts as a Barracks in its home city. 
   increases chance of veteran promotion 50% for phalanxes
   (this is not +50% odds, it's +50% frequency)
=============================================================
14. Techs and Costs:
   Monotheism 300 (384), Theology 400 (600), Theocracy 500 (725)
   Invention 490 (468), Democracy 950 (875), Banking 475 (364)
   Medicine 475 (468) Ironworking 65 (80). Philosophy 325 (276)
   Navigation 500 (485). University 450 (415). 
   Chemistry 900 (800)
   Astronomy, Feudalism, Trade, Republic 150 (145)

   Misc techs rounded to clean numbers. 
   Philosophy now gives a 70% blueprint instead of a full tech.
=============================================================
15. Explorer renamed to Scout. Available with Horseback Riding,
   moves 4 tiles (6 with Map Making, which then makes it identical
   to previous Explorer. Cost reduced 2 shields, same as 
   Horsemen.)
=============================================================
16. QUAY upgrades
   a. Quay-to-Road and Road-to-Quay uses 2/3 move point. (was 1/3, 3/3)
   b. Exiting a city with a quay remains 1/3 move point  (was 1/3)
   c. Time to build Quay is now 1 worker-turn: encourage ancient river importance.
   d. Exiting quay now being 2/3 instead of 1/3 or 1/9 (rail), reduces territorial 
      risk of making quays, somewhat.
   A new server feature simplifies this. <ADD TO: SIMPLIFIERS>
=============================================================
17. Ecclesiastical Palace, cost:70 (was 90). (same as Palace)
=============================================================
18. Zeus promotion bonus changed: instead of The Republic
   tech turning it off, it's Monotheism or Communism that
   turns off the bonus. The two different "make content"
   bonuses were clarified.
=============================================================
19. Adam Smith wonder adjusted back to 300 gold; the former 
   cost increase had been implemented before the WYSIWYG 
   upgrade, which now makes this wonder less OP and no
   longer justifying the cost increase.
=============================================================
20. Legion price adjust 30 (was 32) - got 20% discount like 
   all other foot units, off the classic price, but it was
   overpriced in classic.
=============================================================
21. Hideouts  
   temporary patch requirement for unit to be alone
   was fixed after a bug fix no longer requires this.
=============================================================
22. Tile Claims 
   Fixed a bug where tile claims were only cardinally adjacent
   Requirement for diplomat to be accompanied is only if not 
      in domestic territory.
   Can be now be made on any tile adjacent to existing claim.
   Conflict where Tile Claim can't be made in a base, was 
      fixed.
=============================================================
23. University Pre-req for Steam Engine changed to
   Magnetism. In most cases this will mean Frigates now
   come two techs before Ironclads; rather than possibly
   after.
=============================================================
24. No sea commerce units cause unhappiness, for consistency
   and simplification.
=============================================================
25. Cathedral costs 70 (was 75)
=============================================================
26. Nationalism is +20% sci in original cities
    balances that -15% is global for lux 
=============================================================
27. Clarification: AAA are considered as part of 
   Marine corps land/air/sea. Thus, have gold upkeep not 
   shield upkeep; and get Infantry build slot bonus.
=============================================================
28. Zeppelin 5 turns of fuel: more realistic and provides 
   more possible use for this special unit.
=============================================================
29. Fixed bug (also mp2c) where Airplane was not counted 
   as non-military and couldn't do diplomatic missions 
   to nations with whom you're at peace.
=============================================================
30. Jet fighter types, upgrades
Were underpowered relative to other units.

A:D ratio of jets:mech.inf is now only slightly less than
A:D fighters:alpines (was substantially less, at a time when
    SAM Battery becomes available to make it even worse.)

Stealth Fighter
   A9 D6 Cost:85 was A8 D4.
Jet Fighter
   A7 D6, was A6 D5. (better defender than escort fighter)
Ground Strike Fighter
   A8 D5, was A7 D4

Multirole Fighter, upgrades Escort Fighter
   A6 D7 two turns fuel. Cost: 90
   Range fighter
=============================================================
31. Rapture Rate is here. Allows govs to participate in
   it at different rates; which allows finer balancing of 
   the govs to make them more usable and interesting.

Cn.Monarchy - Non-original cities rapture at 25% 
   Non-original cities with no foreigners rapture at 60%

Republic - Always raptures
           <Foreign rapture at 80%>

Democracy - Cities with 30%+ foreigners rapture at 25% 
            Cities with 20%+ foreigners rapture at 50%
            Cities under 20% foreign rapture at 100%

Communism - Cities rapture 2 out of 5 turns

Theocracy - Raptures 2 out of 5 turns;
  building a Cathedral changes rate to 1 out of 2 turns.

Nationalism - 
Domestic cities rapture at ... ?
Foreign cities rapture 1 out of 3 turns
Non-original cities rapture at ... ?
   until no longer foreign, then at 2 out of 3 turns.
=============================================================
32. Terrain Walls
=============================================================
33. SentryAlways 
		scout, balloon, zeppelin, e.fighter, m.fighter, 
      partisan, awacs, spy plane, satellite
=============================================================
34. Destroy City - Massacre a city (gives global casus belli)
Requires 2 units on tile, actor must be capturer-type.
Foreign city: destroyer gov mustn't be Demo, Theo; 
city size 2-8; 
Domestic city: only avail to Despo, Commie;
15% foreign, must use (D)o command. size 1-8;
==============================================================
35. Huts can now also give:
  * Small bulb awards (1-5 bulbs).
  * a Boat (if on a river)
  * Goods (if discovered by a unit who can carry Goods)
  * A map of the surrounding area (14 tile diameter)
==============================================================
36. Nomadism / Early game balance bonuses 
During the first 5 turns, each Settler gets 1 bulb/turn; this
represents the fact that nomads can learn things too, and
causes less penalty for players in bad starting position 
who must migrate to decent starting position.
==============================================================
37. Boats 8hp - Triremes and Warriors can beat them; similar
   to what was done with Workers/Tribesmen.
==============================================================
38. Terrain Walls are available to be made for any nation 
 who owns The Great Wall. To build them you must select 
 Tile Target with the (D)o command. Features: non-allied 
 units lose all moves when entering or exiting a tile with
 walls. Domestic units get a free fortify bonus on walls,
 which stacks with real fortification. Foreign units who 
 are caught on walls with no move points left get a -50%
 defense penalty. Can't be built on Mountains, Rivers, Bases.
 Be careful, pillage time is 4 turns. 
==============================================================
39. Theocracy spawns Zealots instead of Partisans 
==============================================================
40. Wild Animal hunting now gives food (for edible types).
/set animals >0
==============================================================
41. Mobile SAM gets 2x defense also against Missile units,
   and can now carry two missiles.
==============================================================
42. Armor II bonus vs. CM cut to 50% was (100% i.e. 2x)
==============================================================
43. EFT_REHOME_PCT alters the likelihood of units disbanding
    from conquered/razed cities based on gov type.
    Despotism:15,Monarchy:30,CM/Comm:45,Repub/Natl:60,
    Demo:75,Theo:90
==============================================================
44. Angkor Wat reduces city celebration from 3 to 2.
    Angkor Wat now also works for Theocracy government.
==============================================================
45.Lighthouse never obsolete, but must be built before 
   Electricity. Movement bonus reduces to +1 when combined
   with Nuclear Power bonus. Magellan gives +1 move to 
   nations who don't have Lighthouse. 
==============================================================
46. Citadel of Aleppo - 3x defense impervious to ballistic
   units and siege ram. Currently worthless because
   disallows fortifications so you're better off making 
   city walls + fortifications. Needs to be changed perhaps
   or is pending adjustments to city walls and fortification
   bonuses.
==============================================================
47. Ballista
==============================================================
48. Chand Baori - cost 65 (was 80)
==============================================================
49. Diplomatic Units 
   Emissary - early diplomat, costs 24 (was 26), cannot sabotage cities, moves 3
   Diplomat - req:Economics, costs 30 (was 26), can establish embassy without spent
   Spy - can no longer establish embassy. Emissaries upgrade to Diplomats for free.

   Results:
   (1) Reduced cost with less speed and ability to sabotage,
       is more appreciated for early game use and balance.
   (2) Siege Ram needed for taking out city walls, makes the
       unit more purposeful.
   (3) Ability to establish multiple embassies for slightly
       higher cost, is more appreciated around the time the
       Diplomat now becomes availiable; improves globalness
       of the game.
   (4) Inability for Spy to make hostile embassy (especially
       having 6 moves), repurposes the unit better for
       espionage, decreases OPness, and increases game
       depth and intrigue in having multiple types of 
       diplomatic units.
==============================================================
50. Corruption reducing buildings and wonders will always be
guaranteed to reduce at least 1 corruption (if there is any).
This finally solves an age-old freeciv problem the came from
"double-truncation-rounding" error, which made corruption
reduction nearly worthless in small despotism cities
or medium monarchy cities; yet these are the exact contexts
when corruption loss as a percentage of GDP are at their 
worst and when the game can greatly benefit by an improvement
to help with corruption. 
Courthouse, Palace, Ecclesiastical Palace, Sphinx, Ziggurat,
Supreme Court, and Mausoleum of Mausolos will all reduce
a minimum of 1 corruption, if there is any corruption.
==============================================================
51. JTIDS cost 275 (was 230).
==============================================================
52. AAA need 9 turns of service + 3 turns to convert to M.Sam
    (was 10 + 4).
==============================================================
53. Small balance adjust to early starting techs, gives micro-
expansion of early bronze age strategic pathways, decreases
new-gov rush slightly. Most techs go to 22, masonry and
bronze working go to 20.
==============================================================
54. Theology gives blueprints for Theocracy.
==============================================================
55. Theocracies can make the Patriarch unit, which is a
diplomatic unit that bribes and incites at 1/3 the cost.
==============================================================
56. Zealots can change home city to a foreign ally who is 
 Theocratic. This allows more fluid strategies of bringing 
 all Zealots to fight together under the same command, and
 even for former Theocracies to re-home Zealots into allied
 Theocracies in order to avoid the double-unhappiness
 upkeep which Zealots suffer when not under Theocracy.
==============================================================
57. Theocracy can incite other cities at a 33% discount.
==============================================================
58. Crew Repair simplified: every type of ship gets 10% repair
effectively +1 over previous, slight buff to ship durability
and usability.

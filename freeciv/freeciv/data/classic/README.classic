<u>History</u>
Classic ruleset has a long history. It started deep in the past before Civilization II ever came out. After Civ2, Classic became a synthesis of three things. Civilization I, which it was built from, new features from Civilization II that were better, a few things from other Civ sources which were considered good, and a touch of salt and spice modifications to make it all work right together. The result is an experience of Classic Civilization that is somehow more "classic" than any of the original games--in some people's view at least! 

After getting your feet wet with Classic, you are encouraged to try more modern rulesets, such as:

Civ2Civ3 - A beginner level mix of Civ2 and Civ3 with a liberal amount of other changes.

Multiplayer+ - An even more Classic and much more refined version of classic Civilization, with many balance changes that it functions well even with massive multiplayer human conditions.

Multiplayer II Evolution (MP2) - The ultimate synthesis of Classic Civilization with modern features and advancements. All the best classical mechanics are kept, and only the best newer features and units are added. This preserves the hard-edged chess match of older Civ with the finer balance and portfolio of features, new units, and improvements, of years of evolution and playtesting.

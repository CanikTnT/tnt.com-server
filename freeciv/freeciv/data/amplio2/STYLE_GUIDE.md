# I. About the STYLE GUIDE FOR UNITS.

The style guide is a "strong suggestion" and not a set of absolute rules. 

However: Proportions and dimensions of the current unit art is how it is
for a reason. Also shapes, styles, colours, and details are that way for 
a reason as well.

The guide has collected experience from evolutionary fixing of previous problems.
Volunteer artists are encouraged to meditate on the STYLE GUIDE FOR UNITS before
submitting proposed art. It may help greatly with improving the odds of approval,
and diminish the number of edits before approval.

You may break with the guide when you feel that your artistic competence and judgment
transcend these abstract considerations. There is just greater risk of the work being
rejected or redone later, for the exact reasons which caused the STYLE GUIDE to be 
written in the first place.

# II. STYLE GUIDE FOR UNITS.

1. **Differentiation and Recognition**
a. Differentiation is what causes the eye to rapidly identify a unit as the type it is
and not some other type. It consisit of prominent visual clues. Colours, angles, stances,
weapons, and other styles (like shields, belt buckles, fashion, etc.), when they are 
strong, noticeable, and different from other unit types -- they all come together to help
the eye instantly differentiate the unit from similar looking units. People are playing "chess"
with hundreds of units all over the map... they need to quickly process the
visual info in the mind. 
b. Recognition is what happens when the mind instantly differentiates a unit to identify it
effortlessly.

2. **Familiarity** - There is a tradition for some units to look how they do. This isn't about
conservatism or "it's always been this way so why change?" It's actually part of differentiation
and recognition. A complete makeover of how a unit looks is not out of the question, but it
is much more well-received when it has a strong overlap with the style cues of the previous
graphics it's replacing. All players love upgraded graphics that make them still familiar with 
the look of the unit. But only half will love upgraded looks that are not familiar and look
very dissimilar to the classic graphics they have learned to differentiate and recognise.

3. **Ethnocultural ambiguity** - The units often represent 500 or 1000 year periods for units from tribes
all over the world. That's tough to pull off and can't be done perfectly. But anything that increases
ethnic ambiguity and overlaps many cultural/ethnic/racial/tribal divisions to find their commonality,
helps the entire ambience of the game as a global one. Any changes that diminish the ambiguity are
a strike against the proposed change.

4. **Size and Fit** - At all screen resolutions, the units end up being very small on the screen. It's a
challenge to see them well, which is why #1 and #2 are ranked so high. The unit graphics should try to
maximize the space it lives inside of with palpable details and styling cues that differentiate it.
BAD: tiny units not boldly using their space or exhibiting much visible detail. GOOD: units which 
use the space and size available to them to be recognisable, different, familiar, and well-detailed.

THE SPACE: units live in 2:1 ratio polygons. (96:48 HD or 192:96 4K). It's very helpful when making
the art to superimpose it over a frame or trace-layer with this polygon, to see how to optimise and
maximise use of the space.

5. **Polygon Fit Rules** - The 96x48 polygon only occupies half the space of a 96x48 rectangle. The corners
belong to other tiles.
 (1) However, you will notice in screenshots of the units, that they aren't completely contained
inside the polygon, and some parts can go outside it into the corner regions of the 96x48 rectangle.
 (2) You will also notice that on average, 95% of all pixels ARE inside the polygon.

REASONS for (1): Units come in all shapes and sizes and it's not realistic to force them to fit completely 
in the polygon. Fitting the natural shape into the polygon might force some shapes to be much smaller 
than the relative size we'd expect them to have. For example, we don't expect a Battleship to be smaller
than a Boat, just so it can keep its real shape. 

REASONS for (2): Every pixel that goes outside the polygon risks clashing or overlapping with nearby units 
whose pixels also go outside the polygon. If we are conservative and avoid these outer pixels except when 
necessary, we also diminish the clash and overdrawn overlap of adjacent units. 

For 'outer pixels', use conservative judgment but don't be afraid where necessary.
